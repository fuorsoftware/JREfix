# JREfix
fixes a bug on some computers in which java will not run because it hasn't finished installing when it actually has.

These programs may take a moment to start before they show up, this has something to do with the python compiler I'm using. Please know that I am working on fixing this issue

MAKE SURE THE JAVA FILE IS IN THE JREfix EXECUTABLE'S PARENT FOLDER

I would reccomend re-naming your java file or using copy and paste to make it easier to run
